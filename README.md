# Community Bank React Single Page App

This Github repo contains the code for the card card selection SPA as part of the larger Community Bank FinServ demo environment. This particular repo only pertains to this specific portion of the demo site; the larger repo containing the remainder of the site's code is located on another repo

## Purpose

This SPA portion of the Community Bank demo environment will help Optinauts show how Optimizely Web is compatible with SPA frameworks and libraries like React. As Optimizely continues to release new SPA-focused features like dynamic selectors and smart pages, this portion of the Community Bank app will serve as an environment to demo such features. This SPA portion of the larger demo environment serves to mimic real-life situations where a website may be partially server-rendered and partially client-rendered.

## Running Locally

To run the React portion of the Community Bank demo environment execute the following steps:
* Fork this repository so as not to conflict with the master branch
* Clone this repository on your local machine
* Run the command `npm install` to ensure that any dependencies are saved to your local machine
* Run the command `npm start` to spin up a local Node server
* If you are not automatically taken to the browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`

### Note

The larger Community Bank demo environment is running on a separate Rails server. Running a local instance of the React SPA portion of the site will not allow you to navigate to other parts of the demo environment
